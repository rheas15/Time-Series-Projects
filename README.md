## **1. Analysis of Google Trends Data on "Amazon" Search Term:**
   - This project offers a technical analysis of Google Trends data for the search term "Amazon" from 2004 to the present. 
   - It explores various time series decomposition methods, including additive and multiplicative models, to extract trend and seasonal components. 
   - It employs regression analysis with quadratic trend variables and monthly dummies to predict future search volumes. 
   - The evaluation includes diagnostic statistics, forecasting performance metrics, and recommendations for model refinement.

## **2. FRED Data on Total Business Sales and Inventories:**
   - This project analyzes monthly time series data of 'Total Business Sales' and 'Total Business Inventories' obtained from the FRED database spanning from 1992 to 2023. 
   - Various time series models, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, ETS, and Holt-Winters, are considered and evaluated for forecasting performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). 
   - A Vector Autoregression (VAR) model is fitted to capture interdependencies between sales and inventories, and Granger causality tests are conducted to examine causal relationships. 
   - The project concludes with interpretation of results and recommendations for future research or forecasting strategies.

## **3. Sunspot Activity Prediction:**
   - This project models complex sunspot activity data with a unique 11-year cycle.
   - Nine distinct models are applied for forecasting including ARIMA, THiEF, MAPA, Prophet, LSTM and combination models which are evaluated based on MAPE scores.
   - Vector Autoregression (VAR) was employed to investigate the causal impact of sunspot activity on global wheat prices. 
   - The findings were presented to a technical audience comprising approximately 150 individuals. _The project earned recognition for its ambitious endeavor in modeling a highly intricate dataset._
